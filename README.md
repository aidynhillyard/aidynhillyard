### Case 1: Combine Background Image with Gradient Overlay
For the gradient overlay on my #home-section, I followed this guide from Geeks For Geeks: [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css-combine-background-image-with-gradient-overlay/)

I used a different background image and chose not to gradient but to have one color (black) for the overlay.

### Case 5: Hamburger Nav Area
When I ran into difficulty with getting my hamburger nav to expand vertically, I received brainstorming and bug-squashing help from Matt Powell and Taylor Polli Overturf.  Matt helped me figure out how to move my links to accomplish the styling I needed, and Taylor introduced me to the "viewport height" styling, which I implemented in other sections.
