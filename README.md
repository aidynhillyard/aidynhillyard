## Project Description

My portfolio will feature these sections: about me, skills, projects, and contact me. About Me: This will contain my name and full brand statement. Skills: Skills will be divided into sections (Front-End, Back-End, and Equity), and will have an icon for each section and will display in text format.  Projects will have placeholder images that turn to an opaque background color at hoverover.  MVP for projects section is grid display with responsive design.  Contact me will have a link to my email but not a full form.  Design style will include: 1. full-width image for top banner, 2. minimalistic style for all other sections (few images, 1-3 colors), 3. conversational tone of text sections.

## Additional Libraries
 - FontAwesome: used for hamburger menu and icons for Skills Section
 - Social Icons by Torleif Halseth: [link](https://codepen.io/thalseth/pen/saqIj). I tried using the regular Font Awesome library but could not get the icons to display. Somehow, using the direct HMTL from this CodePen (with my own CSS) worked.

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description  

```
// *************
// Smooth Scroll
// *************

// Code Adapted from Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6677035/scroll-to-an-element-with-jquery

        $(document).ready(function (){
            $("#smooth-about-me").click(function (){
                $('html, body').animate({
                    scrollTop: $("#about-me-section").offset().top
                }, 2000);
            });
        });

        $(document).ready(function (){
            $("#smooth-skills").click(function (){
                $('html, body').animate({
                    scrollTop: $("#skills-section").offset().top
                }, 2000);
            });
        });

        $(document).ready(function (){
            $("#smooth-projects").click(function (){
                $('html, body').animate({
                    scrollTop: $("#projects-section").offset().top
                }, 2000);
            });
        });

        $(document).ready(function (){
            $("#smooth-contact").click(function (){
                $('html, body').animate({
                    scrollTop: $("#contact-me-section").offset().top
                }, 2000);
            });
        });
```

## Issues and Resolutions

 ### Could not get hamburger menu to recognize onclick
 I had to put my JavaScript at the bottom of the HTML body despite having the code in my app.js that is supposed to cause the JS to wait until all HTML is loaded before running.

 ### Could not get jquery hover to overlay img
 There was a typo in my element (. instead of -); once fixed, the hover was successful.

 ### Could not get nav links to function in desktop view
 I had to change them from `position: absolute` to instead be part of a grid and change the row property.

## Citations of Outside Sources

### Case 1: Combine Background Image with Gradient Overlay
For the gradient overlay on my #home-section, I followed this guide from Geeks For Geeks: [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css-combine-background-image-with-gradient-overlay/)  I used a different background image and chose not to gradient but to have one color (black) for the overlay.

### Case 2: Hamburger Nav Icon
I attempted solutions from W3Schools, Geek2Geek, and Dev.to, but ended up following a screenshot from Taylor Polli Overturf shared in Slack.

### Case 3: Layering Divs
I used this guide from TutorialsPoint to layer multiple divs in my "home" section: [link](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/css/css_layers.htm)

### Case 4: Email Link as Button
I used this guide from StackOverflow (from users Ajay and Khaled Al-Ansari) to style my `a` tag as a button and add hover css: [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35457548/how-to-link-a-button-to-an-email-address)

### Case 5: Hamburger Nav Area
When I ran into difficulty with getting my hamburger nav to expand vertically, I received brainstorming and bug-squashing help from Matt Powell and Taylor Polli Overturf.  Matt helped me figure out how to move my links to accomplish the styling I needed, and Taylor introduced me to the "viewport height" styling, which I implemented in other sections.

### Case 6: Jquery Hide/Show Overlay
I used this StackOverflow link to test jquery show/hide [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15722997/jquery-mouseover-image-overlay/15724797), but I used hover instead of mouseover and also used both jquery documentation to explore the hide/show methods: [link](https://api.jquery.com/show/) and W3 Schools' example of the hover method: [link](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_events.asp).  I also received guidance from Nathaniel Stack re: `.offset` and how to position the overlay using the x,y coordinates.

### Case 7: Font Size From Px to Em
I followed this guide that Lauren Colvin linked in Slack to change the font size from px to em: [link](https://andy-carter.com/blog/using-scalable-css-units-for-font-sizes)

### Case 8: Smooth Scrolling to a Div
I added jquery `.animate` to implement smooth scrolling using this guide from StackOverflow, answered by "Steve," edited by "melutovich": [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6677035/scroll-to-an-element-with-jquery)
