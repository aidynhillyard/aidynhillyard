## Project Description

My portfolio will feature these sections: about me, skills, projects, and contact me. About Me: This will contain my name and full brand statement. Skills: Skills will be divided into sections (Front-End, Back-End, and Equity), and will have an icon for each section and will display in text format.  Projects will have placeholder images that turn to an opaque background color at hoverover.  MVP for projects section is grid display with responsive design; Post-MVP is carousel.  Contact me will have a link to my email but not a full form.  Design style will include: 1. full-width image for top banner, 2. minimalistic style for all other sections (few images, 1-3 colors), 3. conversational tone of text sections.

MVP Questions to Resolve:
1. Should my 3rd skills column be titled "Equity" or something else like "DEI" or "Accessibility"?
2. Should I include a "what people have said" section (e.g., like Joe Keohan)?

Post-MVP Questions to Resolve:
1. Should I stick with my current fonts or change them?
2. Should I use a picrew for an image of myself in the About Me section?

## Issues and Resolutions
 ### Could not get hamburger menu to recognize onclick
 I had to put my JavaScript at the bottom of the HTML body despite having the code in my app.js that is supposed to cause the JS to wait until all HTML is loaded before running.


#### SAMPLE.....
**ERROR**: app.js:34 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier                                
**RESOLUTION**: Missing comma after first object in sources {} object
